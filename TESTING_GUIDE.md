# Testing Profile Functionality Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
You're logged in as an **admin user** (which uses localStorage) instead of a real Supabase user. The admin user doesn't create database profiles.

## 🔧 Solution: Test with Real User

### Step 1: Log Out of Admin Session
1. Go to your profile page
2. Click "Se déconnecter" (logout)
3. This will clear the admin session

### Step 2: Create a Real User Account
1. Go to the home page
2. Click "Se connecter" (login)
3. Click "Créer un compte" (signup)
4. Create a new account with:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`

### Step 3: Test Profile Functionality
1. After signup, you should be redirected to the platform
2. Go to your profile page
3. Click "Modifier" (edit)
4. Change your name, city, or class level
5. Click "Enregistrer" (save)
6. Check if changes are saved

## 🔍 Verify in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Table Editor**
4. Check the `profiles` table - you should see your user profile
5. Check the `preferences` table - you should see your preferences

## 🧪 Alternative: Test with Admin User

If you want to keep using the admin user, I can modify the code to:
1. Create a database profile for the admin user
2. Make the admin user work with the database

Would you like me to implement this option?

## 📊 Expected Results

After creating a real user account:
- ✅ Profile data should be saved to Supabase
- ✅ Changes should persist when you refresh the page
- ✅ You should see data in the Supabase dashboard
- ✅ Profile updates should work properly

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check database contents
node scripts/check-database-contents.js

# Check if tables exist
npm run check-db
```
